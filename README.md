# instantjs
A JavaScript game engine. Used to create 2D arcade games or classic retro-style games, though with some work, you can do anything you want.
The engine supports collision, walls, characters, input, save files, shading, raycasts, painting shapes, etc.
## Why use InstantJS?
Unlike other JavaScript game engines, InstantJS has all the building blocks you'll need to make great games, but requires almost no new learning and only requires some basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming fundamentals.
## What are some high points of InstantJS?
- Ease of use. InstantJS is incredibly easy to use
- The Character class. Quickly and simply (with just one line of code!) create moveable physics objects that have easy one-line-of-code ways to render, move, add gravity, bounce, detect collisions, and more.
- The Block class. Create static objects that (with one line of code) act as walls/floors/other obstacles.
- Speed. InstantJS runs incredibly fast.
- Rendering power. With simple canvas rendering, the engine quickly renders sharp, great looking images and graphics. The rendering is instant, so no more graphics running behind after calculations!
## How can I download it?
Just download the instant.js file and include it in your code. To include, put this in the head of your HTML file:
`<script src="path to instant.js file"></script>`
